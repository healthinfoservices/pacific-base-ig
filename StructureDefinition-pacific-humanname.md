A HumanName profile designed for South Pacific jurisdictions. 
This profile supports: 
* Absence of family names
* Patronymic structures
* Multiple given names
* Customary and ceremonial naming
* Distinction between 'usual' (social) and 'official' (legal) names
 
At least one HumanName instance must exist on Patient. Systems SHALL NOT require both usual and official names. 

**Usages:**

* Use this DataType Profile: [Pacific Patient](StructureDefinition-pacific-patient.md) and [Pacific Practitioner](StructureDefinition-pacific-practitioner.md)
