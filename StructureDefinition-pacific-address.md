Address profile designed for Pacific nations where addresses are commonly descriptive and village-based rather than street-based. This profile supports a range of address formats commonly used in Pacific jurisdictions, with commonly required extensions, and general usage guidance. Each national core IG derived from this base profile should further specify mappings of administrative hierarchies to the specific address fields In all cases: 
* text is a mandatory field and should be considered the primary representation of the fully address.
* line is used for free text address lines and may relate to a landmark, school, church etc. rather than a street address.
* Village and Island are added as extensions to the base fhir Address definition to support common Pacific address formats.
* clanAffiliation is already an extension in the PacificPatient, PacificProvider profiles so does not need to be duplicated here.
* geolocation is added as an optional extension to support use case where GPS coordinates are available. It is expected that this will become more common.
* Postal code is often not used, so is currently optional and may be removed (ie 0..0) if not required in the future
* Country is required to support international interoperability
 
Recommended mapping of address fields are below but should be specifically defined and documented in national core IGs 

| | | |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `text` | Full narrative address | Often the primary address form |
| `line` | Landmark, compound, street | Free-text |
| `city` | Town | Mainly urban areas |
| `district` | Ward / district / area council | Country dependent |
| `state` | Province / division | Country dependent |
| `extension:village` | Village | Most rural addresses |
| `extension:island` | Island | Important for logistics |
